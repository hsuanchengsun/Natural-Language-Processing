## Evaluating the Quality of Healthcare Providers using Yelp Review Data
This project aims to evaluate the quality of healthcare providers by analyzing Yelp reviews of businesses in the healthcare industry. The project will be conducted from Nov 2022 to Dec 2022.

#### Objectives
- Conduct data understanding and cleaning activities, including identification and justification of potential data issues via Python
- Develop text preprocessing such as tokenization and normalization for all reviews of businesses in the NLP task with NLTK and Gensim packages
- Apply sentiment analysis to understand each business from their ratings and perform LDA topic modeling to explain different topics about the business quality
- Compare different classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost) with different textural features (BOW, TF-IDF, Fasttext, and GloVe) and select the best model based on their accuracy and AUC scores

#### Methodology
The project will start with data understanding and cleaning activities using Python. The data will be explored to identify and justify any potential data issues that may affect the analysis. Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and normalization will be applied to all reviews of businesses in the NLP task using NLTK and Gensim packages.

Sentiment analysis will be applied to understand each business from their ratings. The LDA topic modeling technique will be used to explain different topics about the business quality.

Finally, different classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost will be compared with different textural features such as BOW, TF-IDF, Fasttext, and GloVe. The best model will be selected based on their accuracy and AUC scores.
